In the Grafana pod, three containers are running:

Grafana: Responsible for serving the Grafana web application and managing dashboards.

Conjur: A container that holds the Conjur application, likely used for authentication and secrets management.

Data Source Updater: A custom application that fulfills the following conditions:

a. It checks the readiness status of the Grafana pod to ensure it is up and running.

b. Upon successful confirmation of Grafana's availability, the application retrieves cyber ark credentials from the designated CyberArk account.

c. The application then verifies whether a data source already exists in Grafana.

d. If the data source does not exist, the custom application creates the data source using the provided information.

e. If the data source already exists, the application updates the data source with the provided information.

In summary, the custom Data Source Updater application within the Grafana pod ensures Grafana's readiness, accesses CyberArk credentials, and performs actions related to data sources based on their existence in Grafana.
